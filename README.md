Kid-Tracker
===========
A device using Raspberry Pi as the microcontroller. The device can be enabled via an SMS. A GPS interfaced with the device tracks the location as the device is enabled, the location received is then sent via an e-mail. A camera is also attached that, similar to GPS is enabled by SMS and takes the picture of that instance, which is also sent along with the location.

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS: 
Integrate sensors- pulse and body temperature to help the parent verify if the child is in trouble or not,include avoice recorder that will record the sounds in the child’s surrounding and then store it and send it to the parent to give the parents more information about the child’s surroundings.
