Kid-Tracker
===========
A device using Raspberry Pi as the microcontroller. The device can be enabled via sound using a sound sensor. A GPS interfaced with the device tracks the location as the device is enabled, the location received is then displayed on the GpsPrune that uses Google maps. A camera is also attached that, similar to GPS is enabled by sound and takes the picture of that instance.

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS: 
Triggering the peripheral devices- GPS and Camera using GSM module (SIM900) instead of sound sensor. The GSM module is triggered via call made by the parent, which then triggers the GPS and the camera. The location is then received on the mobile device via SMS.
Integrate sensors- pulse and body temperature to help the parent verify if the child is in trouble or not,include avoice recorder that will record the sounds in the child’s surrounding and then store it and send it to the parent to give the parents more information about the child’s surroundings.
